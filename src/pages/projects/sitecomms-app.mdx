# The Stages of Development

The kitchen is a place of creativity, where ingredients come together to
create something delicious. However, for some, the process of cooking can be
intimidating. This is why we designed our cooking app, to enhance the
experience of home cooks and turn the kitchen into an enjoyable, creative
space. In this blog post, we’ll take you through the stages of development,
challenges we faced, and our solutions.

&nbsp;

## Research and Planning

We started our cooking app development journey with extensive research and planning. We identified our target audience, which included home cooks ranging from beginners to experienced chefs. We wanted our app to handle everything from recipe discovery to final plating. By catering to a wide demographic, our app would be useful for busy parents, students, and even individuals with dietary restrictions.

## Wireframing and Prototyping

The next stage was wireframing and prototyping. We created wireframes to help visualise the layout and user flow of the app. By doing this, we created an early-stage blueprint to build the app. In prototyping, we created a basic model of the app, allowing us to test core functions and user experience.

## Design and Development

Once we had the blueprint and prototype in place, we moved onto design and development. We designed our app with modern aesthetics, portraying the creativity and fun of cooking. Our team used React Native and Node.js to develop the app. Here are a few examples of what our app looks like:

## Building Interactive Features

One of the most challenging aspects was designing and developing interactive features. Especially in a cooking app where users could not only read recipes but also prepare them. We designed interactive steps, showing ingredients, tools, and cooking techniques in action. For example, users can tap, drag, and swipe through instructions to learn the recipe.

&nbsp;

## Managing Recipe Database

Another challenge was managing the recipe database. With thousands of recipes, we needed a reliable system to store and retrieve them. We used MongoDB as our database, allowing us to store, find, and serve recipes efficiently.

&nbsp;

## Integrating Dietary Restrictions

We realised that many users would have dietary restrictions or preferences. We needed a feature to filter recipes by dietary needs. We implemented a comprehensive filter system, allowing users to select their dietary needs, like vegan, gluten-free, or keto, to find suitable recipes.

&nbsp;

# The Final Product

After months of development, we’re proud to present our cooking app – a true masterpiece for home cooks. With features like recipe discovery, interactive instructions, dietary filters, and more, our app is a complete package to make cooking an exciting experience for everyone.
